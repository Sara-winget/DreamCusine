# DreamCusine
Welcome to the Dream Cuisine project!
## Project Overview
DreamCuisine is an interactive web application that helps users explore recipes tailored to their preferences and mood. Users can input their cravings, dietary restrictions, or simply their mood (e.g., "feeling adventurous," "lazy day," or "need comfort food"), and the app suggests recipes that fit their state of mind. The project includes a recommendation algorithm and a bookmarking feature for favorite recipes.
## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup system for managing user profiles and saved recipes.
- **Mood-Based Recipe Recommendations:** Users select their mood, and the app uses predefined rules or an AI model to recommend recipes.
- **Search and Filter Options:** Allows users to search for recipes by cuisine, preparation time, ingredients, or dietary restrictions.
- **Recipe Bookmarks:** Users can save their favorite recipes for easy access later.
- **Step-by-Step Cooking Mode:** Includes a detailed, guided mode with visuals and timers for each recipe step.
- **Dynamic UI:** Implement smooth transitions and visually appealing animations for a delightful user experience.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Displays user activity, such as their most-cooked recipes and mood trends.
## Tech Stack:
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for a dynamic and interactive UI.
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js for RESTful APIs.
**Database:** MongoDB for storing user profiles, recipes, and preferences.
**External APIs:** Integrate food APIs (e.g., Spoonacular) to fetch recipes and nutritional data.
## Why This Project?
DreamCuisine bridges creativity and functionality by combining mood-based personalization with culinary exploration. Itâ€™s a practical application of front-end and back-end development, offering opportunities to enhance skills in React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and API integration.
